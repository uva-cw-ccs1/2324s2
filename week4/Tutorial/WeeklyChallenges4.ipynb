    "Now that you have some experience with pandas and data exploration in Python, it's time for you to combine and apply this week's knowledge. You will start working on these challenges in the tutorial and will be asked to complete them by the end of the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each challenge, you are asked to provide the programming solution to it as well as a technical interpretation explaining the steps taken and the result.\n",

    "Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.\n",
