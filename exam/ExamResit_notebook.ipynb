    "In the resit of the final exam we will ask you to apply the skills learned inthe class. The exam will test your understanding of programming languages for communication science, your abilities to apply Python to solve programming challenges in the communication science context, and your understanding of basic programming solutions in Python.\n",

Make sure you save the notebook locally before starting to answer the questions. Rename this file according to the following structure: <br>LastName_FirstName_StudentID_Coursename\n",
    "* Fill in your name and student number in the indicated space.\n",
    "* To answer the exam questions, write your answers in this notebook where indicated. The word count for the reflection question is a guideline for how lengthy we expect the answer to be. Take this advice seriously (writing a lot more may result in insufficient time to finish the exam). Remaining below or going over the word count will by itself not lead to a deduction of points.\n",
    "* Answer all questions and check upon completion if you really addressed all (sub-)questions.\n",
    "* Use correct and complete sentences. Poorly or unclearly formulated answers will not be graded.\n",
    "* Make sure to answer all questions in your own words.\n",
    "* Do not provide any irrelevant information. If you provide more answers than instructed, only your first answer will be graded. If your correct answer also includes incorrect or irrelevant elements, these will lead to deduction of points.\n",
    "* You can obtain a maximum of 100 points. The points you can obtain for each question are provided at the respective question.\n",
    "* Re-reading full articles or re-doing the challenges during the assignment will not be possible, due to time restrictions. We advise you to use the materials to look up essential coding details.\n",

    "* Please upload the html version of the notebook on Canvas. \n",
    "* To do so, when the assignment is fully finished (and all the code executed), in Jupyter Lab, select File --> Export Notebook As --> Export Notebook to HTML. An html file will be generated (and probably downloaded to your Downloads folder). Upload this html file to Canvas. This file will be also used for the plagiarism check.\n",
    "* Make sure that the html file is named according to the following structure: \n",
    "LastName_FirstName_StudentID_Coursename.html\n",
    "* If you cannot generate an HTML version from your Notebook (if the option disappeared), upload a PDF instead to Canvas. Please tell your lecturer about it.\n",

    "* Reflection (20% of exam grade): in a short reflection, we ask you to think about the use of programming languages for computational communication science.\n",
    "* Programming 1 (40% of exam grade): in this programming task, we ask you to filter a dictionary and write a new dataset.\n",
    "* Programming 2 (40% of exam grade): in this programming task, we ask you to answer a research question through analysing datasets provided by us.\n",
