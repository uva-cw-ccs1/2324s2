# Week 5

**Status: NOT READY**

This page contains the code for the CCS1 lecture for this week so you can follow along in class. A set of warm-up exercises and challenges is present for this week. The warm-up exercises should be completed before the tutorial. These challenges are your weekly coding practice.

Note that to avoid confusion and version conflicts, we are *not* putting a duplicate on Canvas.
